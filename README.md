# E-LEARNING PLATFORM

## About This Project

This repository contains the source code for a lightweight e-learning platform built with the **Laravel Framework (v12.17.0)**.

The platform's core functionalities include:

- **Secure User Authentication:** Full user management system including registration, login, and profile updates.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** A clear distinction between `Admin` and `User` roles, with protected routes ensuring proper permissions for course management and enrollment.
- **Course Management (Admin):** A dedicated admin panel for Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting (CRUD) courses.
- **User Enrollment System (User):** A simple dashboard for users to view available courses and manage their enrollments.

## Architectural Decisions

- The project follows the **Laravel MVC structure**, ensuring clean code organization by separating application logic, presentation, and data handling.

- Although a **RESTful API** approach was initially considered, a **Blade-based monolithic structure** was selected to better align with the project's UI requirements and to simplify implementation.

- **Laravel Breeze** was used for secure and modern authentication scaffolding. **Custom middleware** was implemented to enforce role-based access control (RBAC), restricting admin routes to authorized users only.
