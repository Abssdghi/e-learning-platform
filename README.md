## Architectural Decisions

- The project follows the **Laravel MVC structure**, ensuring clean code organization by separating application logic, presentation, and data handling.

- Although a **RESTful API** approach was initially considered, a **Blade-based monolithic structure** was selected to better align with the project's UI requirements and to simplify implementation.

- **Laravel Breeze** was used for secure and modern authentication scaffolding. **Custom middleware** was implemented to enforce role-based access control (RBAC), restricting admin routes to authorized users only.
